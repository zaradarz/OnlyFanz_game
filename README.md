# 🎮 Only-Fanz – by Zara Dar


**Only-Fanz** is a simple 2D arcade-style game built using the **Pygame** library.  
You control Zara, moving left and right to catch only the fans 🌀 while avoiding AC units ❄️ and heaters 🔥.  
Rack up as many points as you can before catching the wrong thing!  

All game assets were created using **ChatGPT image generation (April 2025)**.

## 🎨 Customization Tips

- You can replace the image files (`.png`) or sound files (`.wav`) with your own. Just make sure the file names match those used in the code, or update the paths accordingly.
